    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python program that serves as an interactive tool for a friend who enjoys exploring numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program should begin by \n",
    "* prompting the user to enter their name \n",
    "* and then ask them for three of their favorite numbers. \n",
    "* After gathering this information, the program should greet the user with a personalized message that includes their name. \n",
    "* The three numbers provided by the user should be stored in a list. \n",
    "* The program should then check if any of the numbers are even or odd, and store this information in a separate list of tuples, \n",
    "* where each tuple contains the number and a string indicating whether it is \"even\" or \"odd\". \n",
    "* Following this, the program should use a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and for each number, \n",
    "* it should create a tuple containing the number and its square. \n",
    "* These tuples should be printed in a creative and engaging format. \n",
    "* Additionally, the program should calculate the sum of the three numbers and print the result, accompanied by an encouraging message. \n",
    "* Finally, the program should determine if the sum is a prime number and notify the user with an appropriate message. \n",
    "* The goal is to make the tool both enjoyable and informative, \n",
    "* allowing the user to explore their favorite numbers in a fun and interactive way, \n",
    "* while also introducing some interesting logical checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "Enter your name: Alex\n",
    "Enter your first favorite number: 4\n",

    "Enter your third favorite number: 9\n",

    "Wow, 19 is a prime number!\n",
